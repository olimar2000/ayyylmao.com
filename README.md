<p style="background-color:green;">Music is something that is all around us.Influences of it could be what makes us who we are. The power of music is something that people need to acknowledge. Over the years, to me music has helped me through many periods of my life. Some influences it has have could be found such as when I first started falling in love, or when I was going through my depression period, or when I've felt lost in the world, and finally when I needed some motivation in life. In this presentation, I shall be explaining the power of music and the effects one could have through environment, drug usage, and the type of effect certain music has among certain types of people.</p>

</div><p style="background-color:#EE5C3F;">The purpose Holler If You Hear Me is a book written by Michael Dyson is to emphasis on black and hispanic hood struggle. It is to emphasis of Tupac Shakur’s perspective of life.Dyson also talks of Tupac’s philosophies of life, some of the things he has down towards his community, and about his music influences. Dyson talks about Tupac's songs such as his well praised “Dear Mama”. Dyson takes his view of the song of how it praises mothers. More in particular hood mothers. Those who have been left to raise one’s children among impoverished and inhuman situations. As quoted from Shakur “I think all young black males and all hispanic males, all males period, but especially from the ghetto... we have a deep love for our mothers, because they usually raised us by themselves. So you always feel closer to your mom.”can relate to many of those in “hood” situations. The impact of the song has given a reminder to those who can relate that one’s mom is always there. Dyson also talks about how despite his mother’s crack addiction, poverty, and overall depression; that he still sees his mother as a loving person. Even though some of the pain that has been emitted has still lurked around Tupac’s life. That his mother Afeni Shakur is a strong woman who was able to keep her head up and raise him right.Dyson has talked about the livelihood of Tupac's homelife. Dyson explains how his mother Afeni was affiliated with the Black Panthers. Dyson states that the affiliation towards the party has caused huge strains among the two. Dyson talks about how Afeni was heavily involved with the organization that she at times would put it more focus over her own son. Who in fact, are already in impoverished heavily and Dyson stated that she was pregnant with her son during in a holding cell awaiting trial for a bombing conspiracy with the Black Panther. Dyson also talks about a huge epidemic of what crack cocaine on ghettos. Dyson has said that crack addiction, along with gang activity, made a huge influence among the youth group of areas being exposed to. An insight of crack addiction Dyson notable  gives a perspective of crack addiction. Tupac’s mother Afeni was his prime example. Dyson tells of how Afeni addiction caused problems in her family. For example, despite the poverty and homelessness that were present, her alcohol and usage was still present among her entire family. Drug addiction has been a norm for people. The depression and impoverished lifestyle has reduced the mother to use crack cocaine as an escape from reality. Despite that Tupac’s abuse from his mother, he sees her  as a “valiant role model who countered the corrupted natives of official society and history” (Dyson page 36). Dyson explained bits of his trauma from abuse from Afeni violent boyfriend, her addiction, and the depression of leaving home at an early age for a better life. In conclusion, Dyson is depicting the struggles that some may be encountered by many. Dyson choose a perfect example of Tupac’s life. Dyson expresses how his musical influence could relate to many people who know the struggle of abandonment, drug usage, and over all everyday struggle in the hoods.</p></center></center></font>

<font size="4.5"><p style="background-color:#2AC8A7;">Chou and Lin are two colleagues who have started an investigation of music towards people with depression. Lin has taken account of the effects of music towards a number of individuals. Chou got a group of advocates from a psychiatric outpatient clinic of a medical center in southern Taiwan. Lin’s experiment consisted of eight sessions of individual GIM therapy. (guided imagery music, therapy used to explore one's own inner world and help clients to work on significant life issues) Chou has stated in the article that music therapy has been used around the world to treat for psychosis, as a natural anesthesia, to ease the anxieties of birth and terminal illness , and to treat depression. Through thorough research from Hung and Wang, they found that the brain of depressed patients were able to express negative emotions, relieve stress, and enables a person self awareness along with correcting distorted cognition through music. Another interesting finding that Chou and her colleague were able conclude is that music can also affect a person's body flow. Lin has stated that music can also affect cardiovascular, respiratory, reduce blood pressure, regulate breathing, and so much more. Chou has shown that music therapy are based in such a vast of group based on background and behavioral approaches towards an individual. Through extensive research, Chou and Lin were able to find that a subject of one study was in a nirvana state upon listening to therapeutic music. At that state, Chou was able to learn that through the tranquil state that emotions were able to be expressed more thorough at that point. Lin has said that the power of music therapy and music therapy can help one through their depression episode, that it can help them have an enlightenment, deeper thinking, and improve behavior that could potentially release negative emotions. Lin was able to find some key features that music’s connection through emotions could consist of different melodies, sound qualities, beat, and balance and instruments to express various emotions. Chou has shown steps that would help a patient through GIM are first having a conversation by asking about recent disturbing events, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts among the therapist and patients. Then, Lin states that they should work with getting the patient relaxed through breathing patterns. Chou then would start with having the subject to listen to music, to trigger the subjects imagination. Lin found that with a therapist support and guidance, patients are able to describe what they are thinking of, to express emotions, and other related thoughts in a 30-40 minute process. Chou then would be able to analyze what a patient has said and be able to figure out the meaning behind of what one has said. What Lin has concluded through the experiment would be to help a patient with the emotions, to gain realization of unaware emotion and thoughts, and maybe even help one to discover one’s self. Chou believes the work of a therapist is to focus and encourage the patients emotions, sensory images, physical sensations, memories and such. In conclusion, Chou and Lin emphasize the power of music, how it can help people emotionally towards themselves, to express emotions that they thought may have never existed.</p></font>

<font size="4.5"><p style="background-color:#994CB6;">The purpose of Paulson’s Ted talk was to inform people about the influence and impact that has been given to her from music and in depth of guitar. Paulson goes on about how music was very important in her life that it was part of her identity, that it made who she was, and that it gave her a place to belong. An interesting analogy Paulson points out is how music's rhythm, melody, and harmony can connect to our lives.Paulson goes on how music has rhythm, we have routines and habits. Paulson says how that rhythm in our lives help us to remember what to do and to keep us staying in track.  Paulson then goes on talking about how harmony in our lives could family or friends; in general anything that creates a harmonic structure in one’s life. Paulson finally compares melody with us. Paulson says that we the people play on top of everything else are the melody of our “song”. Paulson compares from melody and person that as things change and develop; in both music and a person that it’ll be the same. Paulson then goes on talking about the beautiful connection between music and life. Paulson claims that music can both let us escape our reality as well as letting us bind with reality. Paulson explains that music is that lives inside of us, that we create it and that it creates us, and that our lives are conducted by music as well as composed of it. Paulson states music is a fundamental part of what we are and of everything around us. Finally, Paulson goes on about an interesting theory. Paulson goes on about the string theory.Paulson explains that matter are made up of atoms which are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons which are made up of a quark. Paulson's says that the quarks are made up of little coiled strings and that the vibrations of the strings are what make everything what it is. Paulson goes on saying that the four forces of the universe are gravity and the electromagnetic force could be viewed as music. Paulson explains that physics as the laws of harmony between these strings,chemistry, as the melodies that you can play on these strings, and that the universe is a "symphony of strings". Paulson's concludes that the strings play the universe; that they make up everything we see and everything that we know, that the musical notes make us what we are and that they hold us all together. Paulson believes everything is music, everything she looks at is music, and that even she is music.

The purpose of the video that Hari has presented is to inform his ideas of how drug addiction works. Hari states that drug addiction isn’t a chemical hook problem, but a realized emotional deficiency syndrome. Hari believes what we know about drugs are wrong. Hari gave an example if people were to use heroin for 20 days straight that we’d be addicted to it due chemical hooks. Hari explains from a colleague Alexander that it’s wrong due to other things. Hari explains an experimentation Alexander conducted with two rats. Hari explains that he one mouse put into a cage with heroin filled water where the other mouse was put into a cage with the same heroin water, but with activities to do such as mazes, group of other mouse friends to play with, girl mouse to have sex with, cheese, and many more things. Hari explains through the findings that the mouse with the fun activities almost never touch the heroin tainted where the mouse exposed to the drug alone subsequently will always overdose and die from the drugged water. A human scenario that Hari mentions about are Vietnam soldiers. Hari mentions that 20% Americans were being loaded with heroin. Hari explains that it turns out that 95% of them just stopped and didn’t end up in rehab. Hari questions that maybe chemical hooks aren’t about chemical hooks, but about adaptation of one’s environment. Hari then goes on about human beings wanting a natural and innate need to bond; that when we are happy and healthy we can bond with one another.Hari then gives that idea that once a person is traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, that a person will bond with something that will give that sense of relief whether it may come from gambling, pornography, heroin, cannabis, or whatever. Hari goes on that we will bond and connect with something because that’s our nature. Hari gives a great explanation towards people. Hari tells everyone for a minute to forget about about the legal status of drugs, that we all have the opportunity to get high off of heroin, cocaine, and everything else. Hari then says we wouldn’t become homeless, addicts, or anything due to the sole reason of our bonds. Hari goes on that we wouldn’t do that since people have things going on for them such as a job that one loves, people that one loves and would spend time with, and most importantly that we have bonds and connections that we would want to be present for. Hari claims that the core part of addiction addictions is about not being able to bear to be present in your present life. Hari stresses that we as people treat addicts as low people of society, that we brand them with heinous felonies that will put barriers between them from reconnecting back into a sober life. An example of how drug laws are failing Hari talks about is Portugal. Hari explains that Portugal had a heroin epidemic where they would set harsh laws among the people by stigmatizing them an shaming them more. Hari then says that they eventually decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but take all the money used to penalize the addicts into reconnecting them into society. Hari explains that instead of keeping them jailed, the people of Portugal would help the addicts through therapy, through rehabilitation programs, and ultimately creating massive programs of jobs for addicts by offering to pay for half one an addicts salary. Hari explains that the goal of it was to have the addicts have something to get out of bed for in the morning. Hari finally talks about the results of experiment. Hari concluded from British Journal of Criminology that injecting drug use is down in Portugal by 50%, overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts, and addiction is significantly down, Through Hari’s Ted talk is that everything we know about addiction is wrong and that instead of threatening the love connection we have with an addict is to deepen the connection with them by loving them if they are using or not and to make sure that they shouldn’t be left only and unloved.
